2. How to create a Wireless Sensor Network
	a. To create a Wireless Sensor Network first drag an Area from the left column to the right scene and give the area a name.
	b. Then drag a new Area or a Node into the area.
	c. To link Nodes together first, click on a Node, then in the drop-down menu select a Node to you want to link to and click "Add node".

3. Export
	a. A Bigraph algebraic expression can be generated by clicking "Generate the Algebraic Expression" and shows up in the textbox in the bottom of the application.
	b. A BIG file can be exported by clicking the "Export to BIG File". This will create a "model.big" file showing your current Wireless Sensor Network.
	c. The file will be stored in the same directory as the BigraphUI.jar program.

4. Version specific Notes
	a. If you drag an Area or Node to the scene it cannot be removed.
	b. If you create a Link or Application, it can not be removed.
	c. If you add an Application to a node it cannot be removed.
	d. If you hit the "Create a new Project" button the area is created in full screen. Hitting Esc will minimize the scene.
	e. However, when you return to full screen, the bar separating Area and Node from the scene will be in the middle of the screen but can be moved to the left.
